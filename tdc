Tizen App Development using MS Visual Studio Mobile Center and Team Services
This session presents the process of Tizen app development on the base of Tizen-compatible life cycle and continuous integration services, provided by Microsoft Visual Studio in partnership with Samsung. The Mobile Center Tizen SDK offers device side API and allows collecting the app running time statistics and observing it on the Mobile Center cloud service. The Team Services supply build task queue, which automatically builds, packages, signs and deploys Tizen app right after the app source codes are submitted to the online repository. The entire process is demonstrated with a representative example, comprising a Visual Studio App, a Mobile Center App and a Tizen Xamarin Cross-platform App Solution; attached instructions on how to create and connect all components as well as how to interpret the data registered in Mobile Center.
