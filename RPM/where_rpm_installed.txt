In your linux terminal, not in the tizen shell, please try the following command to see the contents of an rpm:
$ rpm2cpio <filename> | cpio -ivd
Then, the rpm file will be unpacked and you can see the target location of all files in the rpm.




But, if the rpm is a package of a UI app,
please try "pkgcmd" command from the tizen shell.
I can't remember the exact command, but I think the usage of that command looks like:
pkgcmd -i -t rpm -p <rpm file path>
This is the command line tool for tizen package manager.
